# RecFIN-Data-Analysis-Project
This code takes data produced by RecFIN, does some statistical analysis on it, and produces graphic representations of the data.

The 80-16.csv file is produced by going to the link at the bottom of the RecFIN screen for 80-16.pdf and setting up the fields as shown in the pdf image. The data I'm using for this project is the data that has been collected from 1980 to 2016 for all shore fishing modes at every site in the Channel Islands/Ventura/Santa Barbara district (District 2).

The order this code should be run in as of right now to produce the proper results:
  1. data2db.py 
  2. site2db.py
  3. add_site_id_to_data_db.py
  4.
  5.
 
Explanations of code not run above:
  readdb.py
